Hi! This website was built by me, [Srishti Rajeev](). 

This site is for those who want a more in-depth understanding of statistics/math/ML and its applications to biology and neuroscience. The idea is to go over things conceptually, breaking down things into simple and digestible terms so that a stupid undergrad like me (at least at the time of writing this) can build projects based off of these big/fancy words. I'll also be adding more complex concepts & tools later on. 

## Resource Roadmap: 
---
- First and foremost, this has material from MCB447 (my Big Data in Biology course at the University of Arizona)
	- Corresponding textbook: 
	- Thank you to Professor Gutensket. 

## Basic Statistics & Math
- MIT OCW Introduction to Probability & Statistics
	- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2022/pages/classes-reading-and-in-class-materials/
	- This has a variety of problem sets I'd recommend working through.
- Vector Calculus
- Differential Equations
- Linear Algebra: 

## Data Structures, Algorithms, and Coding
- Ah yes, the classic CS50: 
- CS50 Python: 
- R Crash Course: 
- 
- rosalind
- https://rosalind.info
	- This is a GREAT site to work through a variety of bioinformatics problems. AND you'll learn coding in the process. 
NAUR ACADEMIC GATEKEEPING HERE! 

## Neuroscience, Signal Processing
- MNE Python: 
- SciKit, also this: 
- CGSC118A from UCSD
- CGSC344 from University of Arizona (Modeling the Mind)
	- *Note*: This models *cognition* - not neuroscience. Thank you to Dr. Sarah Cook

## STEM Review (Optional)
I think it's important to have a strong understanding of biology, biochemistry, physiology, chemistry, organic chemistry, and introductory physics. Not only did I take these courses in undergrad, I unfortunately also had to study them conceptually for the MCAT. You can see my MCAT roadmap here:
