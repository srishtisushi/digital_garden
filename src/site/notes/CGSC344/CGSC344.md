Notes for Modeling the Mind.  The goal of this course is to introduce students to computational modeling in MATLAB. This course covers:
- Models of perceptual decision making
- Reinforcement learning
- Expected Value Theory
- Processing Behavioral Data via MATLAB
- Fitting models w/least squares, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood methods
- Parameter recovery

**Computational modeling** is the usage of math and logic to understand behavior. In cognitive science, we use hypotheses and theories to understand humans: memory, vision (e.g. Gestalt Principles). 

**Algorithms** are finite sets of rules that can be followed to transform something in predefined ways, and we can use *algorithmic* hypothesis to explain behavior. For example, *telling a computer to do a set of instructions* and seeing how it compares to humans. Does the algorithm we provide it effectively replicate how humans would perform the task?
